# Appreciation Program

The Park Service has just inherited two parks: Wolf Point Park and Raccoon Meadows. Each park has a volunteer program where volunteers help maintain the parks by cleaning campsites, planning educational events, and maintaining hiking trails.

The Park Service would like to combine their volunteers and introduce a volunteer appreciation program, where the top volunteers get a special edition park badge for their service. It’s your job to help complete a program that was partially written by a colleague to help the Park Service determine this season’s top volunteers
